        "The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple machine learning technique used for classification and regression tasks. It makes predictions by finding the k-nearest data points in the training dataset to a new data point and using the majority class (for classification) or the average value (for regression) of those neighbors to predict the target value for the new data point. KNN is easy to understand and implement but can be computationally expensive for large datasets."

This sparsity leads to increased computational complexity, reduced discriminative power, and a need for larger datasets to maintain data density. As a result, KNN may perform poorly in high-dimensional settings, requiring careful feature selection, dimensionality reduction, or alternative distance metrics to mitigate these issues.\n",
